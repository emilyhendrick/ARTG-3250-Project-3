Air Quality Data Display

Data source: https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/ 
Cities used: Boston, Paris, Beijing

Project concept:
A data visualization for air quality, aimed at students and young adults in a mueseum setting. The display uses tissues paper to cover a LED sun, mimicking the effect of real world haze. Users can press buttons to pick a city to see the air quality for, lighting up an LED that marks it on a map and activating the corresponding layers of tissue paper to cover the LED. The aim of this display is to help visualize the impact of air quality on the world around us.
